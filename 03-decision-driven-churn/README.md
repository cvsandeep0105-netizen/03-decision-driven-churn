# 📊 Decision-Driven Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning and converts predictive results into clear, actionable business decisions.  
The focus is on interpretability, business impact, and decision support rather than only model accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict customer churn  
- Identify key churn drivers  
- Provide business-ready recommendations to reduce churn

## 📂 Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset (IBM / Kaggle)
- ~7,000 customer records
- Target variable: Churn

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Feature Encoding  
3. Train-Test Split  
4. Feature Scaling  
5. Logistic Regression (Balanced Classes)  
6. Model Evaluation  
7. Business Insight Extraction

## 🤖 Model
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression  
- Reason: High interpretability and strong baseline performance for business problems  

---

## 📈 Model Performance
- Train Accuracy: ~75%  
- Test Accuracy: ~72%  
- Balanced handling of churn and non-churn classes  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Fiber-optic customers show higher churn probability  
- Customers with high total charges are more likely to leave  
- Streaming service users have increased churn risk  
- Senior citizens and customers with dependents show higher loyalty  

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Improve pricing and service quality for fiber-optic users  
- Introduce loyalty discounts for high-value customers
